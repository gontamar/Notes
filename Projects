Here’s the flow of how your Car Price Predictor works, from entering car details in the interface to getting the predicted price:

1. User Enters Car Details
The user opens the web page and sees a form with dropdowns and input fields for:
Company
Model
Year
Fuel Type
Kilometres Driven

2. User Clicks "Predict Price"
The user fills in the details and clicks the Predict Price button.

3. JavaScript Handles the Button Click
The send_data() JavaScript function is called.
It prevents the default form submission.
It collects the form data using FormData.
It sends an AJAX POST request to the /predict endpoint with the form data.

4. Flask Receives the Request
The Flask backend receives the POST request at /predict.
The predict() function extracts the form data (company, model, year, fuel type, kilometres driven).

5. Model Makes Prediction
The backend creates a DataFrame with the input values.
The pre-trained machine learning model (LinearRegressionModel.pkl) predicts the car price using these inputs.

6. Prediction Sent Back to Frontend
The predicted price is returned as a response to the AJAX request.

7. Frontend Displays the Result
The JavaScript updates the page to show the predicted price in the <span id="prediction"></span> element.

Summary:
User fills form → clicks Predict → JavaScript sends data to Flask → Flask predicts price → result shown instantly on the page.
