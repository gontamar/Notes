Here’s the flow of how your Car Price Predictor works, from entering car details in the interface to getting the predicted price:

1. User Enters Car Details
The user opens the web page and sees a form with dropdowns and input fields for:
Company
Model
Year
Fuel Type
Kilometres Driven

2. User Clicks "Predict Price"
The user fills in the details and clicks the Predict Price button.

3. JavaScript Handles the Button Click
The send_data() JavaScript function is called.
It prevents the default form submission.
It collects the form data using FormData.
It sends an AJAX POST request to the /predict endpoint with the form data.

4. Flask Receives the Request
The Flask backend receives the POST request at /predict.
The predict() function extracts the form data (company, model, year, fuel type, kilometres driven).

5. Model Makes Prediction
The backend creates a DataFrame with the input values.
The pre-trained machine learning model (LinearRegressionModel.pkl) predicts the car price using these inputs.

6. Prediction Sent Back to Frontend
The predicted price is returned as a response to the AJAX request.

7. Frontend Displays the Result
The JavaScript updates the page to show the predicted price in the <span id="prediction"></span> element.

Summary:
User fills form → clicks Predict → JavaScript sends data to Flask → Flask predicts price → result shown instantly on the page.

The working flow from user input to output in **XrayGPT** can be summarized as follows, based on the model documentation, code flow explanations, and architecture notes found in the repository:

---

### **1. User Input**

- **Input Types:**  
  - **Image Input:** (e.g., chest X-ray images)
  - **Text Input:** (e.g., medical questions, prompts, or captions)

---

### **2. Preprocessing**

- **Image Preprocessing:**  
  - Images are processed using vision-specific transforms (resize, normalization, etc.).
  - This is handled by the visual processors, configured in YAML and loaded via `load_preprocess()` (see `xraygpt/models/__init__.py`).

- **Text Preprocessing:**  
  - Text is tokenized using a tokenizer (typically `LlamaTokenizer` or HuggingFace's AutoTokenizer).
  - Converts text to input tokens suitable for the language model.

---

### **3. Encoding**

- **Image Encoding:**  
  - The image is passed through an **EVA Vision Transformer (ViT)** (`eva_vit.py`).
    - **PatchEmbed:** Splits the image into patches, projects them into embeddings.
    - **VisionTransformer:** Processes patch embeddings through transformer layers to produce visual feature embeddings.

- **Text Encoding:**  
  - Text tokens are embedded and prepared for multimodal fusion.

---

### **4. Multimodal Fusion (Q-Former)**

- **Q-Former (`Qformer.py`):**  
  - **Learnable Query Embeddings** interact with both visual and textual features.
  - Query tokens are processed through transformer layers with cross-attention to image features.
  - The Q-Former fuses the information from image and text, creating a unified representation.

---

### **5. Language Model Decoding**

- **LLaMA Language Model (`modeling_llama.py`):**  
  - The fused multimodal representations are passed to a large language model (LLM, such as LLaMA).
  - The LLM decodes the information to generate output text (e.g., a summary or report).

---

### **6. Postprocessing**

- **Text outputs** are decoded from tokens back to human-readable text using the tokenizer.

- **Results** (summarization or answers) are returned to the user via the application interface (e.g., Gradio demo in `demo.py`).

| File                    | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| tokenization_llama.py   | Text tokenization                        |
| eva_vit.py              | Image encoding (ViT)                     |
| Qformer.py              | Multimodal encoding/fusion               |
| modeling_llama.py       | Language model decoding (LLaMA)          |

### **High-Level Flow Diagram**

1. **User Uploads Image and/or Text →**
2. **Preprocessing (Image & Text) →**
3. **Image → EVA ViT → Visual Embeddings**
4. **Text → Tokenizer → Text Embeddings**
5. **Fusion: Q-Former (cross-attention between queries, image, and text) →**
6. **Fused Representation → LLaMA LLM → Output Tokens**
7. **Postprocessing → Final Text Output**
